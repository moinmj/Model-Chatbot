Abstract
The loan market in India has evidenced tremendous growth in the past decade. However, with the increase in the loan market recently, the defaulters of the loan have also been found to be increasing, causing a major concern for the banks operating in India. Hence, to tackle this issue some of the banks have been understood to be taking the help of loan recovery agents whose prime aim is to recover the loans from the defaulters through any (including illegal) means. This research aims at understanding the psychological phenomena that the loan defaulter goes through on being contacted by such loan recovery agents hired by the banks. Qualitative methods have been used to collect the data via 16 in-depth interviews. Based on the study findings, there is an imperative that the societal forerunners and philanthropists continue to use research findings to highlight the prevalence of unethical practices and curb the same.

  Bank Loan as a Source of Finance for  Start-up’s: A Study  Anubhab Patnaik#1, Srinivas Subbarao Pasumarti*2  Research Scholar, Professor & Dean Sri Sri University-Sri Sri University India, India   Abstract- Startup needs to retain tempo with constantly changing technologies and also need to face the risk of becoming technologically obsolete. High costs of credit and are unidentified  major competitive power to match product quality and standards  are  some  other  issues  need  to  be  faced  by  the  small  enterprises.  The  growths  of  these  enterprises  are determined  by  the  availability  of and  accessibility to  the  financial  Resources.  Business functions  on money  but  getting advance  from  a  commercial  bank  is  very  difficult  and  only  few  of  the  startups  are  successful  in  this.  The  truth  is associations which are comparatively new attract the least secure credits of any that a bank may understand.  Key Words-Startup, Credit, Advance, Commercial Bank I. Introduction A  startup  requires  huge  amount  of  money  while  the  generation  of  revenue  by  them  is insufficient.  With  less  profits  and huge expenses,  startups need  funding  to  survive.  Necessary stability  to  the  business  and  stable  running  of  the  business  processes  are  possible  only  by pumping required  amount  of money  to the  startups. Availability of  finance can make  or break businesses. Startup needs finance for achieving goals, short term and long term activities and for meeting  financial  requirements.  Finance  is  important  to  begin  the  business  operations,  for expanding businesses and to recruit staff. Companies can obtain finance from a lot many Sources like loans, investors etc.  In  the  beginning  stages,  expenses  of  startup  companies'  tend  to  go  much  ahead  then  their earnings as they center themselves on developing, testing and making their idea marketable. In many cases,  they  require funding.   Startups enterprises always  look for financial  support  from commercial  banks  or  credit  unions,  in  the shape of  business loans  or  through  Small  Business loans from local banks sponsored by government, or approach nonprofit organizations and state governments for different  grants. Easy and  quick accessibility to  finance for startup enterprises has always been a challenging issue to address by Economists and startup entrepreneurs.  Efficient  financial  decisions  are  essential  for  the  success  of  a  company  as  it  involve  the management  of  financial  activities  and  financial  assets  of  the  business.  The  seller  consumer relationship  is  improved  by  the  startup  enterprises.  Investors  play  a  critical  element  in commencing the startups. Successful functioning of the startup gives  benefit to the investors  as well. Investors are considered  as the backbone  of startup enterprises. Investors help the startup business in many ways. Funding gaps occur usually in cases of companies in a given point of their life and with special field of activity. The problem of funding gap is prevalent in  young, technology-oriented startup Strad ResearchVOLUME 7, ISSUE 10, 2020ISSN: 0039-2049http://stradresearch.org/https://doi.org/10.37896/sr7.10/010107
  enterprises. As a result of the funding gaps, companies with huge growth potential are not able to obtain  the  necessary  capital  for  their  operation;  hence  they  cannot  live  up  to  their  growth potential.  Funding  gaps  evolve  in  case  of  startup  companies  as  a  result  of  their  special characteristics.  In the seed and  early  stages  of  their  lives these  companies  are in the phase  of product  development  or  they  have  just  made  their  market  entry.  They  are  in  the  lack  of collaterals  or  significant  revenues;  hence  they  are  unable  to  obtain  bank  financing.  Balázs Fazekas (2015)  II. Literature Review Sharifi &  Hossein  (2015) stated that small and  Medium  Scale financial  Enterprises have  asset guarantee pattern where entrepreneur fails to pay the fees of various procedural aspects such as guarantee fee, valuation  fee, asset registration fee which  is too high.  If the entrepreneurs  try to fulfills  the  mortgage  requirements  which  again  consist  several  difficult  tedious  processes. Additionally, the huge risk,  huge cost, and finite profits construct more problems for small and medium enterprises  who  apply for  a  loan from  the  bank. The  capital  market and  other  private financial institutions develop gradually in India.  Astebro  & Bernhardt”  (2003)  conducted  research  to  establish link  between the bank advances and survival of new private venture”. They expressed that there is a negative connection between bank advance furthermore, business survival and positive connection between non saving money advance  and  business  survival.  These  think  about  depends  on  the  information  alluding to  an arrangement of independent company propelled in 1987 in U.S. Ghatak,  (2010)  clarified  about  of  the  serious  factors  confronted  by  MSMEs  in  India.  These factures comprised: accessing suitable and timely finance, lack of obtainable information, access to  skillful  manpower,  R&D  facilities  and  restricted  marketing  channels.  Hussain  &  Yaqub, (2010) exposed approximately business  encounters  confronted  by businesspersons in Pakistan. The conclusions were predictable was means the founders of Pakistan are no diverse. They face defies that  other businessmen  face in  emerging nations.  Scarcity of  financial Resources and  or ‘lack of access to ‘financial market’ was the ‘most severe problems. In most situations, they require funding. Startups enterprises always focus for funding assistance from  financial  institutions  like  banks  or  credit  unions,  in  the  different  category  of  loans  or through loans specified for business purpose from local banks sponsored by government, or take assistance from nonprofit organizations and state governments for different grants. Patnaik & Srinivas Subbarao (2020) Commonly banks which are private in nature are afraid to finance to a firm which is established recently, because a startup faces a number of problems which it has to fix so that it grow into a successful  organization  at the  same  time lack  of  collateral  and  high  risk of  losing  are  major barriers  too.  Rather  than  preparing  the  most  impactful  business  strategy  for  this  Startup Company, the intersection of the regulatory environment and various legal issues and laws of the country  where  Startup  is  planned  to  be  set  up.  A  Startup  business  should  be  protected  from specific risk faced by the sector in which it operates. Domeher et al., (2016) suggest that the issue is not so much that start-ups lack access to capital, but rather the stringent  process of  obtaining access to external funding. There is generally little awareness  of  what  is  involved  in  gaining  equity  funding  and  entrepreneurs  are  mostly  under-Strad ResearchVOLUME 7, ISSUE 10, 2020ISSN: 0039-2049http://stradresearch.org/https://doi.org/10.37896/sr7.10/010108
  prepared  for  the  lengthy  procedures.  The  application  process  tends  to  be  bureaucratic  and  is slowed down by protocols and red tape as funders endeavor to gain the confidence and assurance needed to grant funding to entrepreneurs. H.S. Parekh (2004) looked into the job of financial institutions and state offices in stretching out credit  to  small  scale  units  in  his  thesis  and  pin  directs  their  mentality  of  lack  of  interest  in catering  toward  the  necessities  of  the  small  units.  He  was  of  the  view  that  budgetary dissemination need to achieve their lending approaches in consonance with the need of the small segment all  in all  and  the smaller among the small scale  units specifically.  A high  measure of hazard is presented  from  new companies  and their  financing  has a critical  job  since they help new  businesses  at  beginning  phases  to  arrive  at  the  degree  of  gainfulness  and  manageable development in the market Shetty (2017).. Berger  &  Udell,  also  stated  that at  the  point when  firm proprietors  do  need  to  go to external funding  sources,  their  inclination  is  for  obligation  instead  of  value,  since  obligation  doesn't expect  them  to  surrender  possession  or  control  of  the  firm.  Informational  asymmetries  are particularly severe for early stage firms, those in the seed or developmental stages. The general trouble of new companies in getting to fund is probably going to  be bothered by a weak domestic business environment, including deficient lawful structures and stifled budgetary frameworks. However, globalization of the budgetary markets suggests that the startup business people  are  increasing  more  access  to  universal  money  related  markets,  but  frequently  in  a roundabout  way,  by  means  of  via  domestic  banking  systems.  As  a  result,  access  to  the international  Sources  of  finance  may  substitute  for  domestic  institutional  weaknesses. Simultaneously,  this  suggests  startup  business  visionaries  become  especially  touchy  to  the volume and the course of the universal progressions of finance Tornell & Westermann (2005).  III. Conceptual Framework Every new business needs  money. Managing the money of a business is an art and at the same times  a  science  also.  Startups  are  generally  small  in size  and  in the  development  stage  being funded and operated by few promoters or one individual. The main goal of startup enterprises is to provide service or a product which is currently not being available elsewhere in the market, or being offered in an inferior manner. In the beginning stages, expenses of startup companies' tend to  go  much  ahead  then  their  earnings  as  they  center  themselves  on  developing,  testing  and making their  idea marketable.  Availability, spending and  investment of  money are crucial  to a business. Capacity of business for  allowing the  smooth operation  and not lacking funds  for its operations  decides  the  importance  of  finance  in  business.  Making  of  shrewd  and  prudent business  decisions  concerning  cash  flows  and  long  term  funding  plans  depend  on  business financing. Finance is important in every business for different activities. The  problem  of  funding  gap  is  prevalent  in  young,  technology-oriented  startup enterprises. As a result of the funding gaps, companies with huge growth potential are not able to obtain  the  necessary  capital  for  their  operation;  hence  they  cannot  live  up  to  their  growth potential.  Smooth  obtainable  finance  required  for  a  startup  enterprises  have  always  been  a burning issue on focus by Economists and startup entrepreneurs.  Funding gaps occur usually in Strad ResearchVOLUME 7, ISSUE 10, 2020ISSN: 0039-2049http://stradresearch.org/https://doi.org/10.37896/sr7.10/010109
  cases of companies in a given point of their life and with special field of activity. Funding gaps evolve in case of startup companies as a result of their special characteristics.  IV. Research Methodology This  study  is  conducted  through  primary  data  collection  where  a  sample  of 158  from Startup’s  located  in the  18  districts  of  Odisha  are  chosen  for the  purpose  of  this  study.  This geographical  area  has  been  chosen  as they  represent  a large  number of  Startup enterprises  in Odisha. The population frame was drawn from the list obtained from the Startup Secretariat, IED Odisha.  Each  Startup  was  represented  with  one  respondent  only.  The  questionnaires  were distributed based on the random sampling to ensure it is able to represent the sample population. Data collection was accomplished by Google forms and personal delivery. The population of the study  consisted  of  promoters  and  directors  in  the  startup  enterprises.    The  questionnaire comprised of different categories to collect information on challenges and opportunities faced by startup enterprises in financing.  Questions are prepared in 5-point Likert Scale. Statistical package IBM SPSS (21) package was used to conduct all the statistical analysis. For analysis of the collected data test was done using Chi-squared test and for normality of data skewness test were performed.                                                                                                                                                                   Table-1 Demographic profile                                                      Data- Field Survey  This  section  presents  the  opinion  of  startup  promoters  regarding  the  factors  which  create hindrance in attaining bank finance by startup. Different factors were provided in the questioner for  rating.  The  rating  were  taken  on  Likart  5-point  scale  (Strongly  agree,  Agree,  Neutral, Disagree,  Strongly  disagree).  Further  for  validity  of the  opinions  cross tabulation  is  done by comparing  background  variables  of  respondents  (type  of  enterprise,  age  of  promoter, qualification of promoter, experience of promoter) with  respondent’s opinion. The validation is proved using chi-square test.

  VI. Conclusion  Many  startup  enterprises  wish  to  avail  bank  loan  in  fact  large  number  of  startup enterprises see bank loan as a long term source of finance for their business. But in reality only a  very  small number are successful in  getting bank  loan successfully.  The startup entrepreneurs face many problems in availing bank loan and after trying it for number of times  they  go  for  other  source  of  finance.  In  the  current  scenario  many  startup entrepreneurs do not consider bank loan as a source of finance. Although government is taking many steps to provide adequate finance to startup entrepreneurs and for the same cause  many  schemes  are  also  lunched  too  by  the  government  but  the  out  is  still questionable. It is the duty of the government is to not only lunch schemes but also make it sure that the schemes are implemented successfully at the grass root level and see that the scheme reaches to the maximum.

When you’re in need of assistance with your personal loan, having access to the right resources is crucial. One such resource is the personal loan customer care number. The personal loan customer care number is your direct line to the lender’s support team, where you can get answers to your queries, resolve issues, and seek guidance on your loan. To make things convenient for you, we have provided the personal loan customer care number along with other contact details so that you can reach out whenever you need assistance with your personal loan.

Once you have chosen the bank you want to contact, follow this step-by-step procedure to get your issues addressed and resolved in time:

Step 1- Dial the Number: Dial in the customer care number for the financial institution that provided your personal loan or the one you’re considering. Usually, this number can be found on the lender’s official website, loan documents, or statements.

Step 2- Follow the Automated Menu: When you call, you may encounter an automated menu system. Listen carefully to the options and select the one that best suits your inquiry, such as ‘Personal Loans’, ‘Loan Account Information’, or ‘Customer Service’.

Step 3- Verification Process: Be prepared to verify your identity. The customer care representative may ask for personal details like your name, date of birth, loan account number, or other identifying information to ensure security.

Step 4- Ask Your Questions: Once connected to a customer care representative, ask your questions or state your concerns clearly and concisely. Be sure to provide any necessary context or details to help them assist you effectively.

Step 5- Clarify Doubts: If you don’t understand something or need further clarification, don’t hesitate to ask. Customer care representatives are there to assist you, and they can provide explanations or additional information as needed.

Step 6- Follow Up: If the representative promises to take specific actions or provide further information, be sure to follow up if you do not receive a response within the promised timeframe.

Step 7- Feedback: If you have feedback about the customer service experience, whether positive or negative, consider providing it to the financial institution. Feedback helps companies improve their services.
